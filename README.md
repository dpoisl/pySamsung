Network remote control library for Samsung C, D and E-series devices.

This library supports sending remote keycodes and tests to Samsung
network-enabled home entertainment devices (eG TV sets, BluRay/DVD 
player, home theater systems, ...).

This library is currently undergoing rewriting and neither the API
nor the functionality will stay the same.
