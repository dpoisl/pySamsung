Network remote control library for Samsung C, D and E-series devices.

This library supports sending remote keycodes and tests to Samsung
network-enabled home entertainment devices (eG TV sets, BluRay/DVD 
player, home theater systems, ...).

This library is currently undergoing rewriting.


Supported Devices
-----------------

All Samsung C, D and E Series devices with a network port or USB WIFI 
dongle should work.

The library has been tested with the folowing devices:
 - Samsung UE40D5720
 - Samsung HT-D5100


Samsung Network Protocol
------------------------

Unfortunately Samsung does not plan to release details about the
network protocol. This library is based on knowledge reverse engineered
by the fine folks at http://samygo.tv and my own discoveries. 

If you have any additional informations about the network protocol
feel free to contact me or submit a patch.
