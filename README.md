pySamsung - Samsung SmartTV Remote Control
==========================================


Description
-----------

Network remote control library for Samsung C, D and E-series devices.

This library supports sending remote keycodes and tests to Samsung
network-enabled home entertainment devices (eG TV sets, BluRay/DVD 
player, home theater systems, ...).


Supported Devices
-----------------

All Samsung C, D and E Series devices with a network port or USB WIFI 
dongle should work. 

The library has been tested with the folowing devices:

 - Samsung UE40D5720
 - Samsung HT-D5100

Newer devices have - according to some forum reports - switched to an 
encrypted network protocol so this library might not work with F or H series 
devices.


Samsung Network Protocol
------------------------

Unfortunately Samsung does not plan to release details about the
network protocol. This library is based on knowledge reverse engineered
by the fine folks at http://samygo.tv and my own discoveries. 

If you have any additional information about the network protocol
feel free to contact me or submit a patch.
